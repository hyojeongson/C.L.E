        <p>In today’s fast-paced society,
          listening to our bodies is something
          we neglect more and more. If we become
          sick, we let experts “fix” us, rarely
          taking into consideration how we could
          have prevented illness in the first place.
          We at Space10 think it’s about time we
          started thinking about and designing for
          how we can make body awareness an integrated part of our lives,
          in order to prevent diseases that affect both individuals and whole societies.
          We need to reconnect with the most natural and powerful part of being human - our bodies - and also learn to take responsibility for our own wellbeing.</p>
